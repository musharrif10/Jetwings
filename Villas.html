                    <p class="small"></p>
                    <p>Intimate Spaces Of Our Legendary Sri Lankan Hospitality
                        Born out of the comforting luxuries of a welcoming home, our numerous boutique hotels and villas across the island invite you to indulge in our signature touch of Sri Lankan hospitality.
                        
                        Every one of our boutique villas and hotels feature a distinct identity held together by the family values at the core of everything we do. Ever since the birth of our legendary hospitality on the nostalgic shores of Negombo, our founder inspired a commitment to serving the world from our tropical isle. Over half a century later, we have spread our welcoming warmth and personalised care across Sri Lanka with a well-rooted foundation that is bound to make you feel at home, wherever you may find yourself here.
                        
                        Intimately designed with a host of modern amenities, each boutique hotel and villa envelops you in a private world of luxury inspired by their magnificent surroundings. Whether you decide to go back in time at our colonial bungalows amidst the central highlands, float upon inland waters in our island’s first houseboat, or experience glamping on a wild coast, our homes of Sri Lankan hospitality are found in some of the most enchanting settings in the world, with an open invitation for you to step into and discover.
                        
                        And finally, as luxurious pleasures of our hospitality, every one of our boutique hotels and villas also offer a variety of experiences to ensure your stay with us is a memorable one. Beyond each of our premises, the finest of Sri Lanka is at your doorstep – from world-renowned waves for surfing, to a national park with the highest concentration of leopards on earth. A specialty within our premises however, is our selection of Signature Dining experiences. Be it on upon dunes, under the stars, or even simply in your own room, the cozy backdrops throughout our teardrop-shaped isle are yet another touch of our legendary hospitality we look forward to sharing with you in our many homes around Sri Lanka.

                  <br>
                  <p>Contemporary Colonial Charm In The Hills <br><br>
                    Ayubowan! (May you live long)
                    <br>

Take a step back in time, and feel like you haven’t moved anywhere at all. Such is the magic of the City of Lights; fondly remembered as a colonial summer retreat and a cool escape from the tropical heat that shines over the rest of our island.
<br>
<br>

In Nuwara Eliya, holiday bungalows are as old as the city itself – built by the English, adorned with our hospitality, and open to the world. With a timeless spirit and dignified elegance, the olden wonder of our magnificently resorted home in the hills is one we are eager to share with you.
