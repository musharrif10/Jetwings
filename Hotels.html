                          Our Homes Of Sri Lankan Hospitality
                            Spread across the length and breadth of our tropical island, our homes of Sri Lankan hospitality invite you to indulge in our signature brand of luxury, brought to life with the strength of our well-rooted family values. No matter where you may find yourself in Sri Lanka, our doors will always be open.<span class="xyz">
                            
                            Nurtured over generations, this innate sense of warmth and care welcomes you to a variety of enchanting landscapes that inspire our hotels in Sri Lanka. Originating from the birthplace of our hospitality on the shores of Negombo, we have since extended our family to all sides of the island in order to bring you the finest of Sri Lankan hospitality.
                            
                            From the land of our founder’s home in the capital of Colombo, we bring you urban novelty built on family heritage. And as we travel down the ever-popular southern coastline, you have the choice of many sunny settings, including a secluded cove and a magnificent hillock. The deep south then brings you closer to the wild, as we enter uncharted territory that extends to the pristine shores of our untouched east coast, while the top of our teardrop-shaped isle features the great northern peninsula – rich in colourful history that is rivaled only by the ancient kingdoms of our cultural triangle and the colonial legacies of our central highlands. Through the hundreds and thousands of stories that fuel the magic of our land, our many homes welcome you to share in the legendary comforts of our Sri Lankan hospitality.
                            
                            In addition to a host of contemporary facilities and services that complement your modern lifestyle, nearly each and every one of our hotels is committed to a number of sustainable initiatives that have made us an icon of responsible tourism in the region. Championing a harmonious coexistence of community and environment, our homes of Sri Lankan hospitality not only preserve and protect, but also harness the immense potential of our people and natural resources to deliver unforgettable holiday experiences on this vibrant isle.

                  Over the centuries, the seas below us brought the world to these very shores. As the waves crashed against our rocky coast, we watched as foreign cultures melded with our own, in a thriving harmony that transformed an ancient trading post into the bustling coastal city we are proud to call our home. <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  The influences of the world have shaped the very fabric of Galle as we know it. From the iconic Dutch fortress in the heart of the city, to the traditional fishing villages at its fringe, these cross-cultural charms have since extended into the nature of our legendary hospitality, and have been brought to life in an architectural masterpiece designed by Geoffrey Bawa, which will always remain open for you to come and discover our heritage of tropical luxury on the southern coastline of Sri Lanka. <br><br>Indika Gamage

                Nearly half a century ago, our legendary brand of hospitality was born on this very coastline. From the warm hearts of a Sri Lankan family, the values of passion, humility, integrity, and tenacity were brought to life in a charming beachside villa that has since inspired a world of luxury spread across our tropical isle.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                It all began here – at our original home of Sri Lankan hospitality. The home in which we welcomed the world as part of our family, and treated the world as one of our own. From mouthwatering meals to unique experiences, we have always been delighted to share the magic of our land with you. And today, as our timeless seas hold a wealth of stories past, we invite you to our nostalgic shores to begin one of your own.
