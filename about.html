                                <br>
                                Welcome to Jetwing, the largest family of luxury hotels Sri Lanka has to offer!
On this resplendent isle, we wish all our guests a long life. And even though some have called it paradise, we call it home. A home filled with stories untold and wonders enchanted, which I invite you to step into and discover at each of our luxury hotels and villas under the banner of Jetwing Hotels, Sri Lanka.
<br>
<br>

For nearly half a century, we have been honoured to share the magic of our tropical land with the world. With humble beginnings on my family’s favourite seaside town of Negombo, it was my father, Herbert Cooray, who set us on the path we still proudly follow today. He built Jetwing on the strength of family values – with respect at our core, complemented by the inherent sense of care and compassion shared by all Sri Lankans. In unison, these values contributed to a spirit so powerful, that it continues to inspire generations of Sri Lankan hospitality – the luxurious charm which sets us apart, and is wholeheartedly extended to you with warm smiles across every part of our island.
<br>
<br>

Be it hidden amidst the mystique of historical cities, nestled away in rustic villages, cushioned warmly up in the mountain clouds, or pampered down by the setting sun of the Indian Ocean – our doors are always open, wherever you may find yourself in Sri Lanka.
<br>
<br>
The world has graced our shores for centuries, forging a beautiful relationship that has always held a special place in our hearts. So special in fact, that even though you may arrive as guests, you will leave as friends, but return as family. Because when you stay with us, you stay at the home of Sri Lankan hospitality.
<br>
<br>

Welcome to our family – we look forward to meeting you.
<br>

Shiromal Cooray
<br>

Chairman, Jetwing Hotels, Sri Lanka

                            <h2>Our Story</h2>
                            <p class="small-1"></p>
                            <p>Founder: HERBERT COORAY
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                …with a gentle swish another wave met the long sandy shoreline, welcoming another dawn. In the far distance, a solitary man stood gazing out to the brightening horizon. This was a beach he knew inside out, a stretch of coast he loved dearly. He had found his space; being naturally generous, he longed to share it – and so, he dreamed of what it could be, one day…    
<br>
<br>

It was another day on the Negombo beach in the early 1970s; he was Herbert Cooray – a visionary, a pioneer of tourism in Sri Lanka and the founding father of Jetwing. The homely villa he built and named Blue Oceanic of just six rooms may have been small, but the heartfelt warmth it offered was immense. It all began with a humble desire to share the experience of true hospitality of a Sri Lankan family with others. A simple dream which grew to an ever furthering vision that made us – the company he founded, what we are today – one of the largest, most respected, and recognized tourism organisations in Sri Lanka, and a family of hotels like no other.
